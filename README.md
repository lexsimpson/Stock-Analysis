# Stock-Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help our friend Steve and his parents, who are passionate about green energy and want to invest, they just don't know which stock to choose. We are doing an analysis on several green energy stocks over the past couple years, then refractoring our code to make it run faster and more efficiently.
## Results
After refractoring my code I found that it did in fact run faster. Here are images for how long it took to run my original code in 2017 and 2018, which comparing to the VBA challenge photos is significantly faster.

I did run into several issues during this challenge and had to utilize office hours, BCS support, and my classmates for help. One problem I was having was a "mismatch" error. In order to fix this I had to add a (12) at the end of my tickerVolumes to create an array to loop through and match the tickerVolumes(i). Here is an image of the correct completed version of my code.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Refractoring code is very beneficial, and can make an analysis run significantly faster. This is useful for many reasons, one of them being if you Google a question, you would probably like to have your answer within a couple seconds. If Google's code was not as efficient as it is, then you could be waiting a while for that answer. One disadvantage to refractoring code is it takes a lot of time and effort.

These pros and cons apply to my assignment because it did in fact take me a long time to get this code figured out, as it is my first time using VBA. However, it was worth it in the end to help out my friend Steve, and be one step closer to my career goals as I was able to get a lot of practice using VBA.
